                        “Pray for Wuhan. Pray for China,” she urges me,
                        referring to the capital of Hubei Province,
                        where the outbreak started.
                        It is early February, a week and some since Wuhan was placed under lockdown.
                        My mother lives in our hometown in a neighboring province,
                        and like most places in China, her city has enacted quarantine measures.
                        But she is relatively safe there, and knowing that brings me selfish reassurance as
                        I watch the crisis unfold throughout China: I am her only child and live on the other
                        side of the planet, which is still barely touched by the coronavirus.
